## Background and Objectives

In this challenge we will build a program that simulates a horse race. Like in a real race, the user will see a list of competing horses, choose on which horse they wish to bet on and finally find out if their preferred sprinter won or not. The user will be able to place bets until they run out of money.

## Guidelines

This challenge should take you **45 minutes 🕒**.

1. Just like the first exercise, start by writing the pseudo-code with the teacher as a live-code 💻.
2. Spend 20 minutes on your own to try to figure out the solution.
3. Then let's correct it together! 💻

## Pseudo-code

How should your program work when you launch it? Write the pseudo code!

```ruby
# interface.rb

# Pseudo-code:
# 1. Print welcome and the horses names
# 2. Get user's bet
# 3. Run the race 🐴
# 4. Print results
```

Each step above is too general, so **try to build it out in a bit more detail**.

## Step 1 - Dumb horse race

Let's model a horse race. The user can bet on (choose) a horse, the horses run the race (the computer randomly selects a winner), and the winner is printed out in the terminal with a message telling the user if she/he won. Let's start with the pseudo code. How are we going to model the horses?

## Step 2 - Make it loop!

What about adding a balance to the game? Let's say you arrive to the horse race with 100€, win 50€ if you place a correct bet and lose 10€ if your horse does not win. What do you need to change to your horse race program? Let's make sure the user can't play if she/he does not have enough money.
