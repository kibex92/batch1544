## Guidelines

Winter is coming ‚õÑ‚õÑ‚õÑ. We want to build a program to handle our gift list, mark items as bought and eventually find some inspiration from an external website like Etsy. This challenge should take you all day. üéÅ

Like yesterday, start off by writing the pseudo-code in the group as a live-code üíª.

## Pseudo-code

First things first, let's brainstorm the **pseudo-code** together:

```ruby
# interface.rb

# Pseudo-code:
# 1. Welcome
# 2. Display menu (list / add / delete / mark )
# 3. Get user action
# 4. Perform the right action
```

## Step 1 - The menu loop üéÅ

Start by building the main loop displaying the actions and getting user's input:

```bash
ruby interface.rb

> Welcome to your Christmas gift list
> Which action [list|add|delete|quit]?
> list
> TODO: list items
> Which action [list|add|delete|quit]?
> add
> TODO: ask user an item and add it to gift list
> Which action [list|add|delete|quit]?
> delete
> TODO: ask user the index of item to delete and delete it
> Which action [list|add|delete|quit]?
> quit
> Goodbye
```

## Step 2 - List, Add, Delete üéÅüéÅ

Now let's implement the simple actions (`list`, `add`, `delete`).

- How do you model your `gift_list`?
- Do you use a hash? An array?

**Discuss that with your teacher before you start each action.**

## Step 3 - Mark an item as bought üéÅüéÅüéÅ

We want to be able to mark any item as bought:

```bash
ruby interface.rb

> Welcome to your Christmas gift list
> Which action [list|add|delete|mark|quit]?
> list
> 1 - [ ] sockets
> 2 - [X] ruby book
> 3 - [ ] macbook pro
> Which action [list|add|delete|mark|quit]?
> mark
> Which item have you bought (give the index)?
> 3
> Which action [list|add|delete|mark|quit]?
> list
> 1 - [ ] sockets
> 2 - [X] ruby book
> 3 - [X] macbook pro
```

- How do you modify your `gift_list` to store the `status` of each item?
- How does it affect your code?

Again, **discuss with your teacher**

## Step 4 - Find ideas on Etsy üéÅüéÅüéÅüéÅ

You are out of ideas for Christmas and you want to find inspiration from [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com).
Add a new action `idea` to your menu (additionally to the `list`, `add`, `delete` and `mark` actions). Here is how this action could work:

```bash
What are you looking for on Etsy?
> Jeans
Here are Etsy results for "Jeans":
1 - Levis Blue Jeans
2 - Vintage Jeans
3 - Cargo Jeans Pants
4 - White Jeans
etc.
Pick one to add to your list (give the number)
> 2
"Vintage Jeans" added to your wishlist
```

For the scraper, here is a starting script to help you extract the data:

_Disclaimer: to prevent ip banishment from Etsy, we won't scrape Etsy in real time but we will download a html page and scrape it locally_

```bash
# Download the page to be scraped inside your working directory
curl "https://www.etsy.com/search?q=THE_ARTICLE_YOUR_ARE_LOOKING_FOR" > results.html
# get the path to the HTML file
pwd
```
```ruby
# lib/scraper.rb
require 'nokogiri'

filepath = "/path/to/the/HTML/file.html"
# 1. We get the HTML page content
html_content = File.open(filepath)
# 2. We build a Nokogiri document from this file
doc = Nokogiri::HTML(html_content)

# 3. We search for the correct elements containing the items' title in our HTML doc
doc.search('.v2-listing-card__info .v2-listing-card__title').each do |element|
  # 4. For each item found, we extract its title and print it
  puts element.text.strip
end
```

Once your scraper works on your `results.html` local file, update it to connect to Etsy's results page for any keywords and scrape the online page:

```ruby
require 'open-uri'
require 'nokogiri'

puts "What are you searching on Etsy?"
article = gets.chomp

# 1. We get the HTML page content thanks to open-uri
html_content = URI.open("https://www.etsy.com/search?q=#{article}").read
# 2. We build a Nokogiri document from this file
doc = Nokogiri::HTML(html_content)

# 3. We search for the correct elements containing the items' title in our HTML doc
doc.search('.v2-listing-card__info .v2-listing-card__title').each do |element|
  # 4. For each item found, we extract its title and print it
  puts element.text.strip
end
```

- Feel free to scrape another website adapting this script.
- What kind of data structure should your scraper return?
- Also, you can scrape other information than just the name. For example you could scrape the price of the item too. In this case, how should you update the data structure your scraper returns?

## [OPTIONAL] Save gifts in a CSV file üéÅüéÅüéÅüéÅüéÅ
We want to be able to retrieve the gift list any time we launch the app.
Create a file `gifts.csv` to persist your data locally.

Parsing CSV

```ruby
require 'csv'

filepath    = 'gifts.csv'

CSV.foreach(filepath, col_sep: ',', quote_char: '"', headers: :first_row) do |row|
  # TODO: build new gift from information stored in each row
end
```

Storing CSV

```ruby
require 'csv'

filepath    = 'gifts.csv'

CSV.open(filepath, 'wb', col_sep: ',', force_quotes: true, quote_char: '"') do |csv|
  # We had headers to the CSV
  csv << ['name', 'price', 'bought']
  #TODO: store each gift
end
```

- Find the best moment to load the gifts.
- When do you need to save the gifts?
